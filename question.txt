🔹 1. CORE SALES & TREND INSIGHTS

Use these to understand what is happening.

“What is the overall sales trend and how confident is the forecast?”

“Are sales becoming more stable or more volatile over time?”

“Which future periods show the highest uncertainty and why?”

“What does the model predict for average daily and monthly sales going forward?”

“Are there identifiable seasonal patterns influencing sales?”

🔹 2. DRIVER ANALYSIS (PRICE, DISCOUNT, MARKETING)

These reveal why sales behave the way they do.

“Which factor has the strongest relationship with units sold?”

“Is price acting as a demand suppressor or neutral factor?”

“Does discount meaningfully increase demand, or is the effect weak?”

“Is marketing spend associated with consistent sales uplift?”

“Which variable should be prioritized for improving sales performance?”

🔹 3. RELATIONSHIP EXPLORER QUESTIONS (PAIRWISE)

These work perfectly with your two-dropdown relationship explainer.

“Explain the relationship between units_sold and price.”

“Explain the relationship between units_sold and discount.”

“Explain the relationship between units_sold and marketing_spend.”

“Is the relationship between discount and price strategic or reactive?”

“Are any observed relationships strong enough to support decision-making?”

🔹 4. CAUSAL & BUSINESS LOGIC QUESTIONS

These prevent wrong conclusions (very important).

“Does correlation here imply causation? Why or why not?”

“Are discounts driving sales, or are they applied after demand changes?”

“Is marketing spend leading sales growth or responding to it?”

“Which relationships are associative rather than causal?”

“What risks exist if decisions are made solely on correlation?”

🔹 5. WHAT-IF & SCENARIO ANALYSIS

These are high-value executive questions.

“What happens to sales if discount increases by 10% next month?”

“What is the expected impact of increasing marketing spend by 20%?”

“Which scenario produces higher sales: price reduction or marketing increase?”

“What trade-offs exist between discounting and profitability?”

“What is the safest lever to pull based on forecast confidence?”

🔹 6. CATEGORY-WISE STRATEGY QUESTIONS

Perfect for your category-wise Prophet forecasts.

“Which product category shows the strongest growth potential?”

“Do all categories respond similarly to discounts?”

“Which category is most sensitive to marketing spend?”

“Where should marketing budget be allocated for maximum impact?”

“Which category has the most predictable demand?”

🔹 7. RISK, UNCERTAINTY & CONFIDENCE

These align with Prophet uncertainty bands.

“How reliable is the forecast over the next 90 days?”

“What does a wide uncertainty band imply for planning?”

“Which future periods carry higher forecasting risk?”

“Should aggressive decisions be avoided during high uncertainty periods?”

“How should uncertainty influence inventory or budgeting decisions?”

🔹 8. MODEL PERFORMANCE & TRUST

For explainability and evaluation.

“How accurate is the model based on MAE and RMSE?”

“Is the model reliable enough for operational decisions?”

“What are the limitations of this forecasting approach?”

“Which insights are high confidence vs low confidence?”

“Where should human judgment override model predictions?”

🔹 9. EXECUTIVE-LEVEL QUESTIONS (BEST FOR DEMOS)

These make your project stand out.

“Summarize the most important insight for business leadership.”

“What single action would you recommend based on this analysis?”

“What should the business stop doing based on weak relationships?”

“What should the business double down on?”

“What is the biggest hidden risk in current strategy?”

🔹 10. AUTO-INSIGHT GENERATION PROMPTS

Use these to let the LLM lead.

“Generate three actionable insights from the data.”

“Highlight one opportunity and one risk from the forecast.”

“Identify one insight that is counter-intuitive.”

“Explain what the data does NOT support.”

“Provide a data-backed recommendation in one paragraph.”
